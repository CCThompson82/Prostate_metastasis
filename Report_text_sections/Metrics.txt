As this problem has been defined, a metric for classification is required.  A
typical classification metric is 'accuracy' - the percentage of observations
which are correctly classified, however there are several aspects of this
project which make accuracy unsuitable.  The first complication is that
metastasis is a somewhat rare event, which leads to an unbalanced prevalence
within the data set. This is discussed in more detail in the Analysis section,
however in the context of metric selection, the use of accuracy to score a model
for unbalanced data can be misleading.  For example, in a data set where 90%
belong to the negative class, a model that predicts every observation as
'negative' will achieve a 0.9 accuracy score.  Yet this strategy clearly
contravenes the point of generating the model to begin.  Another complication is
that the consequences of calling a False-negative or a False-positive are not
equal in this project.  A metastasis that is missed (False-negative) could lead
to mortality.   A local malignancy that is called as a metastasis
(False-positive), could lead to an unnecessary morbidity, but would not be
lethal.

To address the issue of unbalanced data, one could use a metric such as the
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

$MCC = \frac{TP x TN - FP x FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FM)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)}}$

This metric ranges from -1 to 1, with zero being the score expected by random
guessing.  Thus it provides an informative performance metric without a reviewers
prior knowledge of class balance.

However, the MCC does not incorporate the distinct consequences of FP and FN in
model performance, which would be a desirable charateristic in this project.
The F1 score can distinguish 

For unbalanced sets, there are two metrics that are typically used: F1 score and
the Matthews Correlation Coefficient.  The F1 score is the harmonic mean between
the positive label classification precision and recall.

$F1 = \frac{2TP}{2TP+FN+FP}$

$F_\beta = (1+ \beta^2) \frac{precision\, x\, recall}{(\beta^2\, x\, precision)\,+\,recall} $
