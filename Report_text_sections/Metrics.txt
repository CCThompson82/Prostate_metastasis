As this problem has been defined, a performance metric for classification is required.  The
standard classification metric is the accuracy score, i.e. the percentage of observations
which were correctly classified.  However everal aspects of this
project which make accuracy unsuitable.  First,
metastasis is a somewhat rare event, which has lead to an unbalanced label prevalence
within the data set. The use of accuracy to score a model
for unbalanced data can be misleading.  For example, in a data set where 90%
belong to the negative class, a model that predicts every observation as
'negative' will achieve a seemingly respectable 0.9 accuracy score.  Yet this strategy
clearly contravenes the point of generating a model for prediction in the first place.  Secondly,
the consequences of calling a False-negative (FN) or a
False-positive (FP) are not equal in this project.  For instance, a metastasis that is missed
(FN) could lead to mortality, whereas a local malignancy that is called as a
metastasis (FP), would lead to an unnecessary morbidity, but would not be
lethal.  Accuracy does not distinguish FP or FN in its calculation.

To address the issue of unbalanced data, one could use a metric such as the
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

$$MCC = \frac{TP x TN - FP x FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FM)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)}}$$

This metric ranges from -1 to 1, with zero being the score expected from a model
that guesses randomly.  It provides an intuitive performance metric
without a reviewers prior knowledge of class balance.  However, the MCC does not
distinguish among the different consequences of FP and FN prediction in model performance.

For this purpose, the $F\beta$ score could be used.  While the F1 score
is the harmonic mean between the precision and recall of the named positive
label, a beta parameter may be introduced in order to alter the importance of
recall versus precision within the model performance metric.  Setting \beta to 2
weights recall as twice as important than precision, and is called the F2 score.

$$F1 = \frac{2TP}{2TP+FN+FP}$$

$$F_\beta = (1+ \beta^2) \frac{precision\, x\, recall}{(\beta^2\, x\, precision)\,+\,recall}$$

For the purposes of this project, recall of metastasis is the most important
feature of model performance, however precision is not insignificant.  Therefore
an F2 score was implemented (i.e. $F_\beta$, with $\beta := 2$) as the main
performance metric.  To ensure no model was 'gaming' the performance measure, I
chose to include the MCC value in each assessment as a control for balanced
accuracy.
