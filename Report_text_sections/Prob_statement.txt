The questions that this project aims to answer are :

* Can prostate cancer metastasis state be predicted from a gene activation
(RNA-seq) profile? 

* If so, what genes (individually or in concert) are important for this
classification?

Thus, the goal of this project is to design a model that predicts Prostate
Cancer metastasis using the gene activation profile derived from the patient's
prostate biopsy, taken at the initial Gleason Test diagnosis phase. It is likely
that a  significant feature reduction exercise will be required to reduce the
number of features, as each  RNA-seq profile quantifies expression of 20501
genes.  Upon Feature Reduction, a variety of algorithms will be employed and
tested for predictive performance.  A final model will be built and optimized.
Finally, a function or application will be built that receives an RNA-seq
profile and outputs a prediction for future metastasis.
