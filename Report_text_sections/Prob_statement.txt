The primary questions that this project aims to answer are :

* Can prostate cancer metastasis state be predicted from a gene activation
(RNA-seq) profile?

* If so, what genes (individually or in concert) are important for this
classification?

The goal of this project is to design a model that predicts Prostate
Cancer metastasis using the gene activation profile derived from the patient's
prostate biopsy, taken at the initial Gleason Test diagnosis phase.

To acheive this goal, it is likely that a  significant feature reduction exercise will
be necessary, as each  RNA-seq profile quantifies expression of ~20501 human
genes.  After Feature Reduction, several classification algorithms will be employed and
tested for predictive performance.  A final model will be built and optimized.
Finally, a function or application will be engineered that receives an RNA-seq
profile as an input and outputs a prediction for future metastasis.
