The goal of this project is to design a model that predicts metastasis during
the  biopsy diagnosis phase.  In brief, an extra biopsy from the Gleason Test
would be analyzed by RNA-seq.  The resulting gene activation profile would be
run through an the model to predict whether a metastasis event was likely to
occur in the future.
